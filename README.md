# simple_c_memory_manager
simple memory allocator + garbage collector

This code was written for a university assignment

The purpose of it is to create a reference graph including strong and weak references to
objects with the purpose of simplifying memory management in C.

Since this automates memory allocations and freeing them, heap memory should
become easier to track

This tool is modular and should be adaptable to other C projects.
